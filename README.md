In this article, we dive into the world of **IoT device hacking**, with a specific focus: **gaining a shell** on a target device. This kind of access can open the door to understanding how the device works internally, uncovering misconfigurations, and learning more about embedded Linux systems.

### UART

UART is a protocol used in embedded devices, it transfers data between two pins TX (transmit) and RX (receive). Normally, the pins are on different processors. Data is sent from TX, in a sequence, at a predefined speed. The receiver checks data on RX.

### Finding The UART Interface
#### Examples
UART interface :
`TX`: For transmitting DATA
`RX`: For Receiving DATA
`GND`: Ground
`VCC`: Useless (in our case)


| ![img](attachements/1.png)    | ![](attachements/2.png) |
| -------- | ------- |

**Easy**: 

![](attachements/3.png)

**Medium:**
The connection interface is marked with a triangle:

![](attachements/4.png)

The connection interface is clearly marked:

![](attachements/5.png)

The connection interface not marked and a bit hard to reach:

**Hard:**

**Extreme:**

GPU hacking, JK, still Hard tho

![](attachements/8.png)

#### Hands-on Stuff
Steps Before Starting
- Set the multi-meter to the continuity mode ⎓  
- Find a grounded element on the device, mostly any metal cover on the board.

**Determining `GND`:**
- DEVICE STATE: Shut **OFF**
- Start testing the pins one by one until a beep sounds comes out of the multi-meter

When the COM is on the metal cover, The V on the 3rd pin hole, A beeping sound occures

![](attachements/9.png)

**Determining TX,RX and VCC:**
- DEVICE STATE: Turned **ON**
- Start testing the pins one by one:
	- If the displayed value is = 3.3V -> Thats **VCC**
	- if the displayed value is = 0.0V -> Thats **RX**
	- if the displayed value is > 0.0V -> Thats **TX**

### Connecting the device

| ![](attachements/11.png) | ![](attachements/12.png) |

Using the `CP2102 USB to UART`:
We attach:
- Device's `RX` To CP2102's `TX`
- Device's `TX` to CP2102's `RX`
- Device's `GND` to CP2102's `GND`
- The CP2102 to the computer

Device Manager Interface after connecting the device using CP2102

<span style="color: #10ff90"><b>Green</b></span> Means its working fine 
<span style="color: #ff1030"><b>Red</b></span> Means its not identified by the system and probably requires a driver which we can get from [here](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)

![](attachements/13.png)

The computer is connected to the device using CP2102 Module

![](attachements/14.png)

We can setup Putty to connect to the device: 

Green should be set to `serial`, Blue is the COM interface found in Device Manager, Red is the baud rate

![](attachements/15.png)

The standard baud rates are the following: 
**4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600**.

Guessing the baud is easy, but sometimes engineers get creative, so guessing might not be a good option, the logical way is to use a logic analyzer like the `saleae logic 4` but its no longer sold and also ehm..e..expensive, VERY EXPENSIVE (**400$**), after some research I found a good alternative which is the `TZT USB Logic Analyzer 24MHz 8 Channel`, which is 8 channels not only 4, works with the logic analyzer 2 software, and much cheaper (**5\$** max )

TZT USB Logic Analyzer 24MHz 8 Channel

![](attachements/16.png)

Setting up the analyzer is the same as setting up `CP2102`, we connect it then we open the software:
Connecting the saleae logic 4 to the device

![](attachements/17.png)

After that we press the start button on the logic analyzer 2 software and then turn on the device:
![](attachements/18.png)
we take the bit duration value (8.333μs = 8333ns) and we divide 1 by it which is 
$1/8333 = 0.000120005 ≃ 115200$ 
![](attachements/19.png)

we change that in Putty config and then connect:
![](attachements/20.png)
sometimes the connection of `RX` to the cpu might be cut off like this 

| ![](attachements/21.png) | ![](attachements/22.png) |
|:------------------------------------ |:------------------------------------ |

using paper pin to re-establish the connection between `RX` and the CPU

Now after rebooting and connecting hopefully we get a root shell:

> This was a general approach applied on a specific device, you might face different connectors layout or protection mechanisme might come your way, I hope you got something out of this to counter that. Thank you for reading! (why not give us a ⭐)
